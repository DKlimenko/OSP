In essence, the demon is prematurely removing pages that might be used again. Every time this happens, we increase the risk of a page fault. The MIN_FREE parameter determines how many frames should be free at any given time. For each additional frame that stays free, we increase the risk of a page fault because we have fewer pages in memory. The LOTS_FREE parameter determines how many frames should be freed when the demon runs. For each frame that is freed, as before we increase the risk of a page because we have fewer pages in memory.

Our optimal choice, then, is to set the values as low as possible: MIN_FREE = 1 and LOTS_FREE = 1. In effect, we only free frames when they are just about to run out, and we only free one at a time. This is essentially the same as the second chance algorithm (without a demon): We delay swapping pages until it's absolutely necessary, thus letting pages stay in memory for as long as possible. The statistics give us a fairly linear curve showing that lower values are better. There might be some small variance, however, because the simulation runs for a specified length of time, not for a specified number of memory references. This means that some simulations might go through more sections of high reference locality than others.
